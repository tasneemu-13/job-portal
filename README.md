# Job Portal

This web platform is designed for posting, managing, and applying for job listings. Employers can add, update, and delete job openings, while job seekers can browse and apply for relevant positions. The platform streamlines the recruitment process, making it easy for both employers and job applicants to connect.

This application marks my first attempt at building and deploying a website using the MERN stack. It reflects my passion for full-stack development and my eagerness to create real-world solutions.
